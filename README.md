## Progress Update - 10/12

Hey Drew,

I've been burning the midnight oil and managed to crank out some code. Feel free to check it out if you'd like! 

### Current Status:
- **Work in Progress**: I'm not near the point of compiling yet, but I’ve made a few commits at this stage.
- **What’s Done So Far**:
  - Defined the **constructors**.
  - Added **private member variables**: `numerator` and `denominator`.
  - Began working on the **arithmetic functions**, specifically the `add` function.
